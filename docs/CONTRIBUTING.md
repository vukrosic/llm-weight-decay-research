For the code to be accepted it must be **measured** and **break the record**. 🚀

Previously we were adding more features / code / architectures but records weren't getting broken and there was no progress. 📉

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Consider **more code = bad** (complexity, bloat, maintenance, bugs when upgrading), unless there is a new record in the training speed / loss, which justifies adding code. ✨

## 🛠 How to contribute:

1. 🔍 **Pick a topic / task** from [issues](https://github.com/Open-Superintelligence-Lab/5-dollar-llm/issues) (issues are general name for tasks), carefully read it and understand it
2. 🍴 **Fork the repo**
3. 💻 **Clone it and implement the experiment**, follow README
4. 📊 **Benchmark your changes** against a the baseline that you also measured beforehand. If hardware is limited, use free GPUs (Lightning AI, Colab) and reduce model size (`n_layer`, `n_embd`) for testing.
5. 📥 **Submit a PR** with your findings and comparison data.
