# 5-Dollar LLM (Blueberry 88M)

Help us build top 10 LLM in the world while keeping it fully open source, which will accelerate everyone and everything that uses LLMs (science, technology, medicine, startups, businesses, etc.)

3. **GPT-3** Level by Apr 20 2026
4. **Top 150** in LMArena (GPT-4o-mini level) by June 2026
5. **Top 50** by Apr 2027
6. **Top 10** by Dec 2027
7. We could aim for **Top 1** by 2028, TBD

Can you make our LLM train faster and better?
We keep the contributions scintifically rigurous. See **[Contributing Guidelines](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)** to get started.

## Acceptance criteria:
0. Once you measure an improvement over the baseline according to the [Setup Guide](docs/SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md), submit your code in a GitHub pull request.
1. The LLM must train faster or achieve lower loss on any of the benchmarks (8M, 20M, 100M, 1B tokens).
2. Lower loss takes priority over training speed because pretraining data is limited - if your submission trains slower but achieves better (lower) loss for the same amount of tokens, it will probably be accepted, and vice versa.
3. Add as little code as possible, keep it clean, rewrite AI generated pull request descriptions to increase quality.
4. Submissions are judged case by case, tradeoffs between speed / loss etc. will be taken into account.
